# MultiMediaCollection
You can preview some pictures / videos in the note , just like the following easy way:
```medias
![[XXXXX.png]]
![[XXXXX.mp4]]
![[XXXXX.jpg]]
...
yyyy.png
...
zzz.mp4
```

# Why I create this plugin
I like use `![[xxxx.png]]`  /`![[xxxx.mp4]]`  to preview the picture  or videos  in the note, but some times , I want to preview some pictures or videos in one panel ! Not one by one ordering by the vertical , because I Can't say them without scroll the page. 
Then I Find some plugins can do it , but they are not so good for me , so I create this plugin to do it.
- [LiteGallery](https://github.com/jpoles1/obsidian-litegal) It's a good plugin ,It's exactly what I thought , but must set folder , like `![[../../XXX.png]]` will  cause error , can not find the file ! 
- [MediaCompanion](https://github.com/Nick-de-Bruin/obsidian-media-companion) like a photos gallery , it's so good , but it will  show all the pictures in target folder ! I just want to show some pictures in the note , not all the pictures in the folder.

> [!warning]
> The video file should be  endwith `.mp4`
